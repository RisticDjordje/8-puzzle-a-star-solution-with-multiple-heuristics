    "    we can always make an even number of moves to get all the tiles in the correct order. If the number of inversions is odd, \n",
    "    the puzzle is not solvable.  This is because we need to make an odd number of moves for each inversion,\n",

    "Implemented Additive Disjoint Pattern Database Heuristic, which dominates Manhattan distance since it gives the minimal distance to the goal state. It is calculated by starting from the goal state and then using bfs to see all the patterns always saving the minimum distance taken. Although it takes long to generate it initially, it significantly reduces the time complexity of the heuristic function, making it the fastest for n>=4.  Although there exist many partitions for the disjoint pattern database, I have used the one which research suggests is the perfect balance between memory and speed: 6-3-3.\n",
